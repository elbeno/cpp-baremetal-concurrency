== Introduction

This C++ baremetal concurrency library provides a low-level API for operations
that must be protected in a concurrent environment, without having to know
platform details.

[source,cpp]
----
#include <conc/concurrency.hpp>

conc::call_in_critical_section(
  [] { // do something under a critical section
  });

conc::call_in_critical_section(
  [] { // or, do something under a critical section
  },
  [] { // when this predicate returns true
       return true; });

conc::wait_on(
  [] { // block until this predicate returns true
       return true; });

== Desktop concurrency vs the interrupt model

On a microprocessor, there is only one form of critical section: turning off
interrupts globally. Because this typically happens in a single-threaded
environment, there is little to no efficiency concern. However as soon as
multiple threads are introduced this becomes a problem. Having effectively a
single global lock to protect every piece of data that can be modified
concurrently, even data that are unrelated, is not a good idea.

[source,cpp]
----
int data1;

conc::call_in_critical_section(
  [] { // read/write data1
  });

// ...

int data2;

conc::call_in_critical_section(
  [] { // read/write data2
  });
----

With a global critical section mechanism, two entirely separate pieces of code
that touch distinct data may still contend for resources. On a single-threaded
microprocessor this is not an issue; in a multithreaded environment, it is.

To get around this issue, critical section calls are by default distinct -- and
the above code will _not_ cause contention -- but can be tagged with template
arguments to indicate that they protect the same thing:

[source,cpp]
----
int data;
struct data_tag;

conc::call_in_critical_section<data_tag>(
  [] { // read/write data
  });

// ...

conc::call_in_critical_section<data_tag>(
  [] { // read/write data again
  });
----

In this case, without tagging there would be a data race as two different threads may access `data` concurrently.

== Re-entrancy

In general, re-locking the same mutex recursively is possible using
`std::recursive_mutex` but it is almost universally considered bad design to
have to rely on this. Such calls can always be refactored to protect the data
without re-entrancy into the critical section.

[source,cpp]
----
int data;

auto recursive_function() {
conc::call_in_critical_section(
  [] { // read/write data
       // and then possibly make a call to
       recursive_function();
  });
}
----

This code will cause a deadlock (even though `call_in_critical_section` is
untagged) and should be refactored so that the access to `data` is protected for
as small a time as possible, and no functions with potentially-unknown paths
should be called inside the critical section.
